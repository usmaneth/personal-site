    content: `# Time to Finality: Best Metric For Blockchain Speed

An introduction to the concept of Time to Finality (TTF) and why it's a better metric for blockchain speed than transaction per second.

Time to Finality (TTF) represents the duration required for a transaction to become irreversible on the blockchain. Unlike TPS which only measures raw processing speed, TTF provides a more accurate representation of when a transaction can be safely relied upon.

## Why TTF Matters

1. Security Guarantees
2. Real-world Applications
3. Network Efficiency
